"""
Sweep: seed x data-loss weight ratio.

Purpose: before measuring LLC, pin down whether the "data-phase then
physics-phase" crossover seen in the single baseline run is (a) reproducible
across seeds, and (b) shifts systematically with the data/physics loss
weight ratio (w_ic=w_bc vs w_pde). This is a loss-curve-only precursor to
hypothesis H2.

Architecture, alpha, point counts, and lr are held fixed as controls.
Only w_data (=w_ic=w_bc) and seed vary. w_pde is fixed at 1.0, so
w_data effectively IS the ratio w_data/w_pde.

Edit SEEDS / DATA_WEIGHTS below to change the grid. With n_epochs=3000
and 25 runs, expect this to take a while on CPU — reduce n_epochs or the
grid size for a quick smoke test first if needed.
